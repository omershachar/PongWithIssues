                         PONG!

    A project that probably works. Sometimes. Maybe. 
                   It compiles. That's enough.

          Press [SPACE] to cry. I mean, play.

Game descriptions and famous quotes:

"A playable breakdown."
"Barely functional Pong made by a barely functional dev."
Just Pong. But worse. On purpose.
Codebase held together by duct tape and spite.
A playable breakdown.
When you mix classic arcade with modern despair.
This is not a cry for help. (It is.)
