    Barely functional Pong made by a barely functional dev.

       A project that probably works. Sometimes. Maybe. 
                      It compiles. That's enough.

### ⚠️ WSL / Windows 11 Users – READ THIS
- Windows 11 (WSL2):
You do NOT need an X server (VcXsrv/Xming).
Just make sure your system is up-to-date and fully RESTART Windows if the game window doesn’t appear.

- Windows 10 (WSL2/WSL1):
You MUST install and run an X server (like VcXsrv) on Windows for any game window to appear.

- If you’re using WSL and the window won’t show up:

   - Fully restart Windows.

   - Try again in a fresh terminal.

   - Still stuck? Check your Windows version and WSLg setup.
